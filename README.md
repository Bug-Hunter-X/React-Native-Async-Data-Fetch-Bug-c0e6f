This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native applications involving asynchronous data fetching. The `Bug.js` file showcases the erroneous code, which attempts to access data before it's fully loaded from an asynchronous operation. The `BugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version of the code using promises and states to handle asynchronous operations and ensure data is available before rendering.
